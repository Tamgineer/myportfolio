            <p>I created a pathtracer which can produce artistic effects during rendering. This project is an adaptation of an <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">tutorial</a> by Peter Shirley</p>
            <div align="center" class="subheading">Introduction and background</div>
            <p>Raytracing is a method of rendering technique in computer graphics, which simulates the physical transport of light in order to procedurally generate an image onto a screen. My project aims to demonstrate if non photorealistic techniques can be applied in a raytracing context.</p>
            <div align="center" class="subheading">Justification of project</div>
            <ul>
                <li>No post processing step</li>
                <li>No texturing</li>
                <li>No inverse hull</li>
                <li>Popularity of the "2D" look using 3D in the animation and films industry</li>
                <li>Using the same shader under the hood</li>
                <li>Make each object be unique and have control on how they look</li>
                <li>Simulation of interaction of light with materials, whilst maintaining a stylistic look</li>
            </ul>
            <div align="center" class="subheading">Aims and objectives</div>
            <p>For the project I aimed to provide the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide 3 examples of non photorealism in my project which utilises raytracing (with the minimum goal of 1). This includes creating an image output for a raytracer</li>
                <li>Produce a raytraced image as an output. The image can be in any image format. The image need to utilise the technique of raytracing in order to create the image.</li>
                <li>To produce minimal artifacts in the final render.</li>
            </ul>
            <div align="center" class="subheading">Testing</div>
            <p>For testing, the results would be qualitative data. I would need to demonstrate that the raytracer can produce 3 examples of non photorealism.</p>

            <img class="image-main-large" src="../images/cel.png">
            <div align="center" class="subheading">Conclusion</div>
            <p>The outlines were able to work extremely well against flat surfaces, but struggle against reflective smooth surfaces. Cel shading required context in where the light source was.</p>
            <div align="center" class="subheading">Evaluation</div>
            <p>Overall, from the many challenges I faced when tackling the project, I was satisfied with the output of the outlines that my raytracer could produce, but not with the cel shader nor the painterly rendering. Despite this, I was able to demonstrate non photorealism in my application, as well as conceptualise a few techniques that could be used despite not having the opportunity to attempt the methods.</p>
            <div align="center" class="subheading">Future work</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementation of triangles (followed by mesh importing)</li>
                <li>Optimisation</li>
                <li>Use GPU for faster rendering (includes removing recursion)</li>
                <li>Rethinking how rays could be utilised</li>
                <li>Better Bounding volume heirarchy for optimisation</li>
                <li>Optimisation of rendering many planes onto a scene (for better painterly rendering)</li>
            </ul>
