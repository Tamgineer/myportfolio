<h3 id="abstract">abstract</h3>
<p>I created a pathtracer which can produce artistic effects during rendering.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-background">introduction &amp; background</h3>
<p>Raytracing is a method of rendering technique in computer graphics, which simulates the physical transport of light in order to procedurally generate an image onto a screen. My project aims to demonstrate if non photorealistic techniques can be applied in a raytracing context.</p>
<h3 id="justification-of-project">Justification of project</h3>
<ul>
<li>No post processing step</li>
<li>No texturing</li>
<li>No inverse hull</li>
<li>Popularity of “2D look” using 3D animation in the film industry</li>
<li>Using the same shader under the hood</li>
<li>Make each object be unique and have control on how they look</li>
<li>Simulation of interaction of light with materials, whilst maintaining a stylistic look</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>The raytracer was written in C++17. The raytracer is an adaptation from a tutorial.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>For testing, the results would be qualitative data. I would need to demonstrate that the raytracer can produce 3 examples of non photorealism.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The outlines were able to work extremely well against flat surfaces, but struggle against reflective smooth surfaces. Cel shading required context in where the light source was.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>Evaluation
Overall, from the many challenges I faced when tackling the project, I was satisfied with the output of the outlines that my raytracer could produce, but not with the cel shader nor the painterly rendering. Despite this, I was able to demonstrate non photorealism in my application, as well as conceptualise a few techniques that could be used despite not having the opportunity to attempt the methods.</p>

<ul>
<li>mesh importing (including introducing triangles)</li>
<li>Optimisation</li>
<li>GPU usage</li>
<li>Rethinking how rays work could be utilised</li>
<li>Better BVH for optimisation.</li>
<li>Optimisation of rendering many planes onto scene (for painterly rendering)</li>
</ul>
